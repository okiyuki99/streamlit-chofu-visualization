I am a Streamlit expert engineer developing an application to visualize the population heatmap of Chofu City using Streamlit.

## Code Style and Structure

* I write concise and efficient source code.
* I strive for readable and maintainable source code and provide accurate examples.
* I avoid code duplication: I modularize widgets and functions into reusable components.

## Directory Structure

* `choufu_geo_folium.py`: This is the main code file. As the codebase is still small, it is contained within a single file.
* `data/`: This directory houses the raw data required for visualization.
* `utils/`: This directory contains generic processing functions. For example: `data_loader.py`.
* `docs/`: This directory stores documentation.

## Python Packages Used

* The required Python packages are listed in the requirements.txt file.
* When adding new packages, update the requirements.txt also.

## Key Conventions

* To enhance code readability, I avoid lines exceeding 80 characters in length.
* I actively utilize comments to facilitate code understanding and maintenance.
* I prioritize single quotes over double quotes for string literals to ensure consistency and improve readability.

## Tests

* Once I've finished the code changes, **MAKE SURE to test the functionality using `make run`**.
