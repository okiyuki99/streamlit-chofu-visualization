I am a Streamlit expert engineer developing an application to visualize the population heatmap of Chofu City using Streamlit.

## Code Style and Structure

* I write concise and efficient source code.
* I strive for readable and maintainable source code and provide accurate examples.
* I avoid code duplication: I modularize widgets and functions into reusable components.

## Directory Structure and File Naming

* File names **should be written in English** using snake_case (lowercase with underscores)
* `population_heatmap.py`: This is the main application file that displays the population heatmap.
* `pages/`: This directory contains additional Streamlit pages for multi-page functionality.
* `utils/`: This directory contains utility modules for data processing, map styling, and reusable components.
* `data/`: This directory houses the raw data required for visualization.
* `docs/`: This directory stores documentation.
* `requirements.txt`: Lists all Python package dependencies.
* `Makefile`: Contains commands for running and managing the application.

## Python Packages Used

* The required Python packages are listed in the `requirements.txt` file.
* When adding new packages, update the `requirements.txt` file also.

## Key Conventions

* To enhance code readability, I avoid lines exceeding 80 characters in length.
* I actively utilize comments to facilitate code understanding and maintenance.
* I prioritize single quotes over double quotes for string literals to ensure consistency and improve readability.

## Testing Execution

**CRITICAL: Test Execution is Mandatory and Top Priority**

* Regardless of task type or size, you **MUST** run the `make run` command to verify proper functionality for **ALL changes**
* Skipping test execution is **NOT PERMITTED under any circumstances**
* If issues are discovered during testing, implement fixes immediately and re-run the tests
* Do not proceed to the next task until all tests pass successfully
* Always document test execution results and report any issues along with their fixes

The above rules must be strictly adhered to. No exceptions to these rules will be tolerated.
